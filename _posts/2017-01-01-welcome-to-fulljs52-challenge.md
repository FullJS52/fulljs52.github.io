### Hi! My name is Lukasz
I'm a web developer with more than 10 years of experience.

FullJS52 is my challenge for 2017.

<!--more-->

You can find more about me on my site [gasior.net.pl](http://gasior.net.pl) or on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaszgasior).

### Why FullJS52?

I love to learn (and to explore new things). I'm constantly learning a lot (from video courses, blogs, twitter, sometimes books) and I practice a lot.

I also like to share my knowledge - on my blog, video-blog, local meetups, by writing a book :), etc.

For many years I was involved in web projects related with .NET (ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC). 
JavaScript was always important for me, but currently, thanks to Node.js, I'm spending more and more time with this language.

With FullJS52 I'd like to combine these two things - my willingness to share knowledge and time I spend mastering JavaScript.

I hope I will also sharpen my writing skills (in English) and maybe meet some great JavaScript passionates :)

### So what is FullJS52

* **FullJS** is a shortcut for "Full Stack JavaScript". Yes, JavaScript is not only for FrontEnd. Thanks to Node.js it can be also used in the BackEnd - and this is great!
* **52** means my challenge will last for 52 weeks (yep, full year!).

**FullJS52** is a nice, short name ... and the domain was available :)

My plan is to write a simple JavaScript project every week.<br/>
I will publish each project on [GitHub](https://github.com/FullJS52?tab=repositories) and write short summary on this blog.
Everything related with my challenge I'll also share on Twitter with [#FullJS52](https://twitter.com/search?q=FullJS52).

In these projects I'll use Node.js, MongoDB, React, Redux, React Native, Express.js ... and many more "JS things".
Currently I have on my list about 20 projects and I'm adding a new ones constantly. If you have an idea for a project I can implement as part of my challenge you can 
share it with me on [Send a project idea](/send-project/) page.

Additionally to this blog and projects on GitHub I'm sharing interesting (in my opinion) posts on my Flipboard magazine [http://bit.ly/TheBestOfJS](http://bit.ly/TheBestOfJS).

So, in my FullJS52 challenge I will cover various different things\libraries\technologies ... but only JavaScript can dance in this Club :)

### Wish me luck!

That's all for today!<br/>
For me it is a time to start working on my first project.<br/>
I'll publish it on Sunday, 8th of January.

What about you? ... maybe you will start your own challenge and implement your 52 projects? :) 
Please let me know if you will join FullJS52!
